    <p>Bullet bill bonanza 2 is a continuation of the last game bullet Bill bon<br>
    anza and the point of the game is to dodge bullet bills that appear on the<br> 
    screen the randomness of the game comes from the bullet bills and the<br>
    fireballs. The game is hard and get exponentially harder as you go on. The<br>
    game ends when you get hit by the bullet bills or a fireball.One of our<br> 
    successes were that we got the boss battle to work and the fireball mechanic<br>
    to fire.some problems we ran into was how to make the bullet bills follow<br>
    you but we fixed that by making it point towards you and move so that it<br>
    would always move towards you. Another problem we had was the lag as the <br>
    game went on we fixed this by making the bullet bills delete themselves <br>
    after a time limit.</p>
